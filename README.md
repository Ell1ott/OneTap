# 🟣 Onetap – One button. Everything handled.

An all-in-one life assistant where you just speak, and the app handles the rest: organizing thoughts into todos, calendar events, diary entries, reminders, or tracking stats — no typing, no menus.

## 🧠 Example Inputs

- ✅ **“Gotta remember to buy milk”** → Creates a **To-Do item**
- ⏰ **“Need to cancel Netflix before May 4th”** → Creates a **To-Do with a deadline/reminder**
- 📖 **“Today I went to the beach with friends…”** → Logged as a **Diary entry**
- 📅 **“Want to meet up with Mickel at 6”** → Adds a **Calendar event**
- 🏃‍♂️ **“Did 30 pushups and ran 3k today”** → Logged in the **Fitness tracker**

## 🎯 Goals

- 🎙 One-button voice input
- 🗓️ Calendar & reminders support

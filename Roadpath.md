## Ideas


### intergration with different apps
it's super important that when building OneTap we remember that people already got other apps, that they already use daily. So they will wont want to switch these app over. This means that OneTap should be as good as possible to integrate with these apps

Definitly:
- Calender
    - Google calender
    - Outlook

Possibly:
- Task manegers
    - Notion
    - Trello
- Maps - for example to quickly getting directions to a saved spot
    - Google maps
- Fitness - for stat tracking
    - Strava?
